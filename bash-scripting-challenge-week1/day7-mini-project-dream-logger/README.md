# Day 7 — Mini-Project: Dream Logger 

## The Story

Imagine you’re a digital dreamkeeper.

Each morning, you wake up not just to start your day, but to capture your imagination before it fades. Maybe you saw flying whales, purple moons or maybe a vending machine that dispenses memories. And maybe, just maybe you want to log those dreams in a clean, simple way that doesn't require signing up for yet another app.

That’s what this project is for.
