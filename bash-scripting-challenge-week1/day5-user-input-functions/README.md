# Day 5 – Blessing the Terminal, Blessing the Soul

---

## What We Did

Today, we took a beautiful detour from our usual scripts and created something simple but powerful: a blessing script.

Yup. A script that *blesses you*. Because let’s be honest, life gets hard. Tech can be stressful. And sometimes, you just need your computer to remind you that you matter.

## How It Works

The script greets you, asks for your name, and then gives you a random blessing from a small list of affirmations. It’s like a personal cheerleader — except in your terminal.

Here’s the vibe:

- You open your terminal.
- The script says hello and asks for your name.
- It waits like a calm monk.
- Then… boom. You get a blessing. One that just might make your day.

## What We Learned

This wasn’t just about writing a cool script. It was about learning how to:

- Ask for the user’s name
- Store messages in a list
- Pick one message randomly
- Make the whole thing feel smooth and personal

More importantly, we learned how to make tech feel *warm*. And that's something school doesn’t really teach.

## Why This Matters

Look you can learn all the commands in the world. But if you forget to check in with yourself? To pause, breathe and speak kindly to your own mind?

You’ll burn out.

This script is tiny, but it’s meaningful. It reminds you: you’re not just here to type commands and fix bugs. You’re here to create. To heal. To grow.

## Try This

- Swap out the blessings with your own quotes, scriptures, rap bars or grandma’s wisdom.
- Set it to run automatically when you open your terminal.
- Share it with a friend who needs a pick-me-up.
