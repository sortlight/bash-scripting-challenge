# Day 6 â€” Countdown Timer Script

## The Story

Somewhere in the multiverse, Tony Stark is running late for a very important test launch of a new prototype Iron Suit. Jarvis is down. Friday is rebooting. And you're the only one left in the lab who knows how to write shell scripts.

So what do you do?

You spin up a **countdown timer** like a true Bash Avenger.

## About This Script

This Bash script is a simple **countdown timer** that asks the user for a number of seconds and then counts down to zero, second by second, like a launch pad in a Marvel movie.

Perfect if you're:

- Timing how long your coffee should brew
- Giving your sibling exactly 10 seconds to get off your computer
- Or just want to feel like you're defusing a bomb (without the danger)

---

## What It Does

- Welcomes the user (you know, for that Marvel cinematic touch)
- Prompts for a countdown duration in seconds
- Counts down to 0 with a one-second interval
- Prints a celebratory message once the time is up

---

## How To Use

1. Open your terminal.
2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x countdown_timer.sh

```

Run it:


    ```bash
./countdown_timer.sh

```
