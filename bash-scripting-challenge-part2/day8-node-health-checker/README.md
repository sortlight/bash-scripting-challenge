# Node Health Checker  


## Introduction

Welcome to Week 2 of the Bash Scripting Challenge. This week moves beyond basic syntax into real life scenario-driven scripting. You’re no longer just a beginner. you’re a systems thinker in the making fam.

**what we got:** 

Today we are Built a script to check the health of multiple nodes and output their status in a readable report. Think of it like a simple uptime radar.  This script simulates what many sysadmins and SREs do every day. which simply explains validating the availability of services. Whether you’re monitoring your home lab, staging servers or production APIs, uptime checks like this form the backbone of basic observability. Stay with me.

## Why are we doing this?

Whether you're running a cluster of Raspberry Pis in your basement or monitoring servers in the cloud, keeping tabs on your nodes is critical. This script gives you a simple way to automate that and collect logs.

## Use cases

Lets say you are managing multiple servers and want a quick pulse check. Maybe it’s your homelab. Maybe it’s your production network. Either way, this script gives you visibility without needing fancy tools or expensive dashboards. Lets get to it fam!

## Built With

 * Bash

 * ping

 * while read loop

 * A little paranoia

## Purpose

Bash script that:
- Reads a list of IP addresses or hostnames from a file (notes.txt)
- Pings each node once
- Reports whether the node is reachable (UP) or unreachable (DOWN)
- Logs the output in a local report file


```yaml


- `node_health_checker.sh` – The main executable Bash script

- `nodes.txt` – A plain text file containing IPs or domains to check

- `health_report.txt` – The output log generated by the script


```

# How to Use

1. **Prepare your list of nodes:**

Create or edit the `nodes.txt` file. Each line should contain one IP address or domain name.

Example:

8.8.8.8
localhost
example.com

2. **Make the script executable:**

```bash
chmod +x node_health_checker.sh

```

3. **Run the script:**

```bash
./node_health_checker.sh

```
The script will ping each node once and print its status to the terminal. A copy of the report will also be saved to health_report.txt.
