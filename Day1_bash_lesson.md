Day 1 – Terminal Ninja Basics
Date: 2025-06-27
Theme: Foundations matter — I took command of the terminal.

🔧 What I Did
Opened the terminal and explored basic navigation: cd, pwd, ls

Created my very first Bash script: day1_hello_world.sh

Learned about the importance of the shebang line #!/bin/bash

Used echo to print messages

Gave my script executable permissions with chmod +x

Successfully ran my script using ./day1_hello_world.sh

📜 Script Example
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

# Day 1 - Hello World Bash Script

echo "Hello, Prophet Gabriel 👋"
echo "Today is $(date)"
echo "You’ve just written your first Bash script — glory to God!"
🧠 What I Learned
🖥️ Terminal is Power
The terminal is not just for hackers in movies. It's where real power lies. For someone like me building a path in cybersecurity, automation, and Web3 — understanding the terminal is non-negotiable.

💡 The Shebang Line Matters
The first line #!/bin/bash tells the system how to interpret the script. It's like declaring the language upfront — no confusion, no surprises.

🔐 Permissions Are Gatekeepers
I saw firsthand that if a file isn’t marked as executable, it won’t run. That’s not a bug — it’s a built-in layer of security and control.

✝️ Purpose + Code = Power
What hit me most is this: the terminal isn’t just technical. It's spiritual too. Typing that first echo felt like planting a seed. I’m not just learning Bash — I’m building a prophetic brand that automates purpose. Every script is a prayer in motion.

🪄 Reflection:
Today was a foundational win. It wasn’t flashy, but it was solid. I now understand how to create, permission, and run a Bash script — that alone unlocks so many possibilities in automation, bug bounty workflows, spiritual journaling, and beyond.
