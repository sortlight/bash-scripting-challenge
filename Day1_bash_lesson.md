Day 1 â€“ Terminal Ninja Basics
Date: 2025-06-27
Theme: Foundations matter â€” I took command of the terminal.

What I Did
Opened the terminal and explored basic navigation: cd, pwd, ls

Created my very first Bash script: day1_hello_world.sh

Learned about the importance of the shebang line #!/bin/bash

Used echo to print messages

Gave my script executable permissions with chmod +x

Successfully ran my script using ./day1_hello_world.sh

Script Example
bash



    > #!/bin/bash

    > # Day 1 - Hello World Bash Script

    > echo "Hello, Prophet Gabriel ðŸ‘‹"
    > echo "Today is $(date)"
    > echo "Youâ€™ve just written your first Bash script â€” glory to God!"


What I Learned
Terminal is Power
The terminal is not just for hackers in movies. It's where real power lies. For someone like me building a path in cybersecurity, automation and Web3 â€” understanding the terminal is non-negotiable.

 The Shebang Line Matters
The first line #!/bin/bash tells the system how to interpret the script. It's like declaring the language upfront â€” no confusion, no surprises.

Permissions Are Gatekeepers
I saw firsthand that if a file isnâ€™t marked as executable, it wonâ€™t run. Thatâ€™s not a bug â€” itâ€™s a built-in layer of security and control.

Purpose + Code = Power
What hit me most is this: the terminal isnâ€™t just technical. It's spiritual too. Typing that first echo felt like planting a seed. Iâ€™m not just learning Bash â€” Iâ€™m building a prophetic brand that automates purpose. Every script is a prayer in motion.


Reflection:
Today was a foundational win. It wasnâ€™t flashy, but it was solid. I now understand how to create, permission, and run a Bash script â€” that alone unlocks so many possibilities in automation, bug bounty workflows, spiritual journaling, and beyond.

Next Steps:
Day 2: Learn about variables, user input, and logic

Start building dream logging and spiritual automation tools
